# **FoodToken Smart Contract**

A decentralized ERC20 token-based food redemption system built on Solidity. The `FoodToken` enables users to earn, burn, and redeem tokens for predefined food items, providing an innovative use case for tokenized assets.

---

## **Description**

The `FoodToken` is an ERC20 token with customized functionality for use in a gamified or tokenized food ecosystem. Users can mint tokens (admin only), burn tokens, and redeem them for food items. It includes predefined food items such as Pizza, Burger, Sushi, and Steak, each with associated costs in tokens. The contract leverages OpenZeppelin libraries for secure and efficient implementation.
